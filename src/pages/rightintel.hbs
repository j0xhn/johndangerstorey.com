        While attending Dev Mountain we had a presenter come talk about their startup called Right Intel.  They mentioned they were in need of a developer to convert their normal site into a responsive one.  I had started using bootstrap and was familiar with thier grid system so I quickly jumped on board working with their designer.

        The position has had me implement google analytics, A/B split testing, and form submital through PHP.  Building {shortcode} templates has been my most enjoyable project, as well as becoming better aquainted with GitHub and how to work with a development team that is already setup and going.  Also writing javascript to fade in and out the background images and auto-download PDF files after form submital.
